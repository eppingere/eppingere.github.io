        <h2 id="proj"><b>Project Descriptions</b></h2>
        <p>In my free time I like to work on fun side projects. If you are interested in them, I've listed the summaries for a few of them below. And if you would like to learn more, I've included some links you can go to.</p>

        <h3 id="ava"><a href="https://avancemos.github.io">AVAncemos</a></h3>
        <p>Project for potential startup. Developing unique method using advanced AI to embed product-placement-type ads into user-generated content. AVAncemos allows advertisers to show brand loyalty easily and efficiently without expensive ad campaigns.
          Particularly effective for Exposure advertising. Currently in development. Patent Pending. <a href="https://github.com/avancemos">Checkout Our GitHub!!</a></p>

        <h3 id="gentrification"><a href="https://eppingere.github.io/finding-gentrification">Using Housing Data to Identify and Predict Gentrification</a></h3>
        <p>Independent big data research project. Developed a unique Gentrification Index that quantifies gentrification in a geographical region. Allows for gentrification to be identified historically and potentially allows for gentrification to be identified
          as it occurs. Recognized by Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, Pittsburgh Data Works, Pittsburgh Super-Computing Center, Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, and IBM Watson Research Lab. <a href="https://goo.gl/HxkTxp">Checkout The Project Portfolio!!</a></p>

        <h3 id="reservoir">Passive Self-Tessellating Unit as Cost Efficient Reservoir Cover</h3>
        <p>Junior engineering project. Developed cost efficient reservoir cover to reduce water loss due to evaporation in drought-stricken and water-scarce areas. This solution costs one tenth of current comparable solutions. Achieved this by designing
          a self-assembling reservoir system with no moving parts nor electronic components. Currently working to implement in California. Patent Pending. <a href="https://goo.gl/1PRt3j">Checkout My Project Portfolio!!</a></p>

Used robotic planning algorithms to manipulate high degree of freedom robotic arm in complex and changing environment.</p>


        <h3 id="app"><a href="https://goo.gl/FtPkry">Pittsburgh Parking Optimization Smart Phone Application</a></h3>
        <p>Ongoing independent project in mobile app development. Developing an Android app that uses a device's GPS location to determine most efficient parking location. Currently developing method for interfacing with ParkPGH app to enable users extended
          parking times and decrease parking rates in the City of Pittsburgh. <a href="https://github.com/eppingere/park-opt">Checkout The Project GitHub!!</a></p>

        <h3 id="queens">Numericality of Solutions for N-Queens Problem and Mathematical Formula for Intelligent Square Ranking</h3>
        <p>Ongoing independent research project. Developed computationally efficient method for intelligent ranking of squares for N-Queens problem. This method allows for more efficient computation of single solution to N-Queens problem for significantly
          larger N. Additionally, created efficient algorithm to compute number of solutions given any N. Computed values for large values of N to N=19. <a href="https://goo.gl/Ot5P3Q">Checkout My Project Portfolio!!</a></p>

        <h3 id="bacteria">Bacterial Genome Modification Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Independent research project. Determined ideal plasmid concentration for maximal bacterial genome transformation efficiency. Received Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science Directorâ€™s Award for Excellence in Microbiological Research. Recognized
          by Bayer HealthCare Corporation for Medical Research and Innovation. <a href="https://goo.gl/5ZQdZ5">Checkout My Project Portfolio!!</a></p>

        <h3 id="blog"><a href="https://dailykvetcher.blogspot.com">The Daily Kvetcher: Political Satire Blog</a></h3>
        <p>Perhaps to mentally cope with the 2016 election season, began to write political satire. Topics include pertinent presidential candidates: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Gary Johnson!? Currently working towards recruiting more writers for
