        <h3 id="numa"><a href="https://github.com/cmu-db/terrier/pull/851">NUMA Aware Thread Pool Scheduler</a></h3>
        <p>Built NUMA aware thread pool for database. Enables parallel scans of database tables by NUMA region. Integrates with system mutexes to allow for threads to do productive work while waiting on a system latches. Designed to emulate the
          performance benefits from the morsel scheduler in Hyper through NUMA Aware data processing and SQLOS’s quantum-based thread scheduling </p>

        <h3 id="b-plus"><a href="https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2020/project2.html">Concurrent B+ Tree</a></h3>
        <p>Implemented B+Tree database index. Designed to be highly concurrent. Enable reads, non-splitting writes and deletes to be latch-free. Performs comparably to BW-Tree on many workloads and outperforms it by up to 20x on random
          highly-concurrent reads and writes.
        </p>

        <h3 id="malloc"><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-f10/www/labs/malloclab-writeup.pdf">15-213 Malloc Lab</a></h3>
        <p>For 15-213: Intro to Computer Systems' Malloc Lab, implemented fully functional memory allocator with highest memory utilization of all students in course.</p>

        <h3 id="babble"><a href="https://devpost.com/software/pennapps18-2pjcx0">Babble: 100% Offline, Self-Propagating Messaging for Low-Connectivity Areas</a></h3>
        <p>For PennAppsXVIII, built Babble, the world's first and only chat platform that is able to be installed, setup, and used 100% offline. This platform has a wide variety of use cases such as use in communities with limited internet access
          like North Korea, Cuba, and Somalia. Additionally, this platform would be able to maintain communications in disaster situations where internet infrastructure is damaged or sabotaged. ex. Warzones, Natural Disasters, etc.</p>
        <p>I built offline install using Android Beam over NFC. One of the main challenges was dealing with the way that Android Beam sends installable files. Debugging that was probably the most challenging aspect of the hack that I was entirely
          responsible for.</p>
